# TODO Group Steering Committee
## Resolution 2020-05
## Status: Approved on 2020-12-11

## Subject: Suggested changes for Steering Committee member selection

In the Slack channel for the Steering Committee of the TODO Group, as well as in [Pull Request #90](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/pull/90) in the TODO Group Governance repo, the committee reviewed and adopted the following resolution:

We will amend the [organisation charter](/CHARTER.adoc) to clarify the dates and timings of the election and terms of both elected and appointed steering committee members. A summary of the proposed changes:

- Specify appointed member terms start on February 1 and last 2 years
- Provide more flexibility in the nomination/election timing (Sept-Nov
instead of Sept only)
- Specify appointments happen at start of year after newly elected
member terms begin

The proposed changes to the charter are as follows (initially proposed as [#90](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/pull/90)):

```diff
- ... Committee member terms shall begin on January 1st of the year following election or appointment, and terminate on December 31st of the second year following election or appointment.
- ... In each calendar year, the group shall hold an election to fill elected positions which will be vacated at the end of that year. The election process shall include nominations and voting during the month of September.
- ... In each calendar year, the committee shall appoint one (1) member to fill the appointed position which will be vacated at the end of that year. The appointment shall be made during the month of October, by the current members of the commitee at that time.
+ ... Elected committee member terms shall begin on January 1st of the year following election, and terminate on December 31st of the second year following election.
+ ... Appointed committee member terms shall begin on the first day of the month after their appointment, and terminate on the last day of the month exactly 24 months after their appointment, unless the appointment is to replace a departed member as detailed below. Typically an appointed term will be February 1st for term start and January 31st two years later for term end.
+ ... In each calendar year, the group shall hold an election to fill elected positions which will be vacated at the end of that year. The election process shall include nominations and voting no earlier than during the month of September and no later than during the month of November.
+ ... In each calendar year, the committee shall appoint one (1) member to fill the appointed position which will be vacated that year. The appointment shall be made in January immediately after the start of the term for new elected members, by the current members of the committee at that time.
```
