# 🧩 TODO Strategic Goals

As a result of the discussion from September's Steering Committee meeting, a set of strategic goals for 2021 were defined and commented in the following deck:

* [Strategic Goals 2022](#proposed-2022)
* [Strategic Goals 2021](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IWFi7SMFBpjRq6xkaAu0dnsrDJ4KKCuTVj0HGA_uUyg/edit?usp=sharing)

Based on this, we would like to bring the goals to the TODO Group for review and sign-off by the Steering Committee in order to let the TODO Group shape the program and execute.

The goals will be revisited and updated yearly.
