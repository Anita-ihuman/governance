## What is the OSPO Associate Program?

TODO Group Community is open to all. Sometimes, there are community participants who wish show their organization efforts on fostering OSPO adoption and enable the worldwide community of practitioners.

Community participants coming from an organization with an established OSPO or similar open source initiative can support TODO by becoming `General Members`. To those open source communities or project focused on [OSPO-related topics](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/) who help OSPOs but may not have an OSPO, they can support TODO becoming `OSPO Associates`.

OSPO Associates is a TODO Program that aims to work collaboratively across communities that are helping the OSPO movement to build the most comprehensive OSPO solutions infrastructure and network.

## Who can request to be an OSPO Associate?

Being promoted as an “OSPO Associate”, means that your organization is committed to collaborate with other peers to enrich the OSPO tools and services infrastructure and offer better assistance to OSPO.
